# yolov8_custom_object_detection
Custom YOLOv8 model trained for detecting and categorizing sunglasses, hats, handbags, and scarves in images.

<br>

This project utilizes the YOLO v8m.pt model, a medium-sized variant of YOLO (You Only Look Once), for object detection in images. The focus is on identifying and classifying specific fashion items, including sunglasses, handbags, scarves, and hats. The YOLO v8m.pt model offers a balanced approach between computational efficiency and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time fashion item detection. The project aims to showcase the capabilities of YOLO v8m.pt in recognizing various accessories, contributing to the field of computer vision in the context of fashion and style.
